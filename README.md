# Infinite Scroll Feed

This project implements an infinite scroll feed using Angular, designed to efficiently load data in chunks as the user scrolls down.

## 🌟 Features

* **Infinite Scrolling:** Utilizes the Intersection Observer API to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the feed, triggering the next batch of data.
* **Mock API Service:** Data is fetched from a local mock service to simulate real-world API latency and pagination.
* **Modern Styling:** Styled using Tailwind CSS and Flowbite for a responsive and modern user interface.
* **Angular Routing:** Configured for component-based routing.
